    "\n",
    "Defining a linear regression in simple terms, its the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship betweeen two or more variables. In a simple linear regression there are two variables, the dependent variable, which can be seen as the \"state\" or \"final goal\" we study and try to predict, and the independent variables, also known as explanatory variables, which can be seen as the \"causes\" of the \"states\". \n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one independent variable is present the process is called multiple linear regression. When multiple dependent variables are predicted the process is known as multivariate linear regression.\n",

You can interpret this equation as Y being a function of X, or Y being dependent of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plot the model, you will see it is a line, and by adjusting the \"slope\" parameter you will change the angle between the line and the independent variable axis, and the \"intercept parameter\" will affect where it crosses the dependent variable axis.\n",
